Comments on the complexity:
    + sum_to_n_a(): use loop to calculate the result
    time complexity: O(n)
    Space Complexity: O(1)

    + sum_to_n_b(): use a mathematical formula to calculate the result
    time complexity: O(1)
    Space Complexity: O(1)

    + sum_to_n_c(): use recursion to calculate the result
    time complexity: O(n)
    Space Complexity: O(n)
